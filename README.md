# FASTQ_tools
This repo has a few tools that help organize FASTQ files for downstream bioinformatic pipelines. The tools include 1) checking sequence length, 2) trimming sequence to desired lengths, 3) merging R1 and R2 reads of paired-end sequence data, and 4) concatenating FASTQ files from the same libraries.
